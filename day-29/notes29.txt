Obect :
	Object consists of properties and methods.

Creation of an object:
		
	objname = keys : values

objects have keys which are converted into a string type,the properties had methods , they don't follow the insertion order.

create object
....................
	
	let mobile = 
	{
	    brand : "samsung",
	    weight : 189,
	    isWorking : true,
	    11 : "android version",
	    displayInfo : function(){
	        console.log(` the brand of any mobile is ${brand} and weight is ${weight} which is in workingcondition 	${isWorking} , also with an android  version of ${11} `)
	     }
	}

add key and value to the object 

	mobile.camera = "64px";


this keyword
....................

in an object this referrs to the object.
when we use "this" keyword alone ,then it points to global object,
in a function "this" refers to a parent object.

ex:
value = 22;   //always give datatype otherwise it will become property. to the window object.

console.log(value);
console.log(this);         




problem : create two students having properties as name,rollno,class, showDetails using object constructor.
